        It's coming on Christmas<br>
        They're cutting down trees<br>
        They're putting up reindeer<br>
        And singing songs of joy and peace<br>
        Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on<br>
        <br>
        But it don't snow here<br>
        It stays pretty green<br>
        I'm going to make a lot of money<br>
        Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene<br>
        Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on<br>
        <br>
        I wish I had a river so long<br>
        I would teach my feet to fly<br>
        I wish I had a river I could skate away on<br>
        I made my baby cry<br>
        <br>
        He tried hard to help me<br>
        You know, he put me at ease<br>
        And he loved me so naughty<br>
        Made me weak in the knees<br>
        Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on<br>
        <br>
        I'm so hard to handle<br>
        I'm selfish and I'm sad<br>
        Now I've gone and lost the best baby<br>
        That I ever had<br>
        I wish I had a river I could skate away on<br>
        <br>
        Oh, I wish I had a river so long<br>
        I would teach my feet to fly<br>
        I wish I had a river<br>
        I could skate away on<br>
        I made my baby say goodbye<br>
        <br>
        It's coming on Christmas<br>
        They're cutting down trees<br>
        They're putting up reindeer<br>
        And singing songs of joy and peace<br>
        I wish I had a river I could skate away on<br>
