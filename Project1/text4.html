        They paved paradise<br>
        And put up a parking lot<br>
        With a pink hotel *, a boutique<br>
        And a swinging hot spot<br>
        <br>
        Don't it always seem to go<br>
        That you don't know what you've got<br>
        Till it's gone<br>
        They paved paradise<br>
        And put up a parking lot<br>
        <br>
        They took all the trees<br>
        Put 'em in a tree museum<br>
        And they charged the people<br>
        A dollar and a half just to see 'em<br>
        <br>
        Don't it always seem to go<br>
        That you don't know what you've got<br>
        Till it's gone<br>
        They paved paradise<br>
        And put up a parking lot<br>
        <br>
        Hey farmer farmer<br>
        Put away that DDT now<br>
        Give me spots on my apples<br>
        But leave me the birds and the bees<br>
        Please!<br>
        <br>
        Don't it always seem to go<br>
        That you don't know what you've got<br>
        Till it's gone<br>
        They paved paradise<br>
        And put up a parking lot<br>
        <br>
        Late last night<br>
        I heard the screen door slam<br>
        And a big yellow taxi<br>
        Took away my old man<br>
        <br>
        Don't it always seem to go<br>
        That you don't know what you've got<br>
        Till it's gone<br>
        They paved paradise<br>
        And put up a parking lot<br>
        <br>
        They paved paradise<br>
        And put up a parking lot<br>
