            Diamonds and Rust

        <p>
            Well, I'll be damned<br>
            Here comes your ghost again<br>
            But that's not unusual<br>
            It's just that the moon is full<br>
            And you happened to call<br>
            And here I sit<br>
            Hand on the telephone<br>
            Hearing a voice I'd known<br>
            A couple of light years ago<br>
            Heading straight for a fall<br>
            <br>
            As I remember your eyes<br>
            Were bluer than robin's eggs<br>
            My poetry was lousy you said<br>
            Where are you calling from?<br>
            A booth in the midwest<br>
            Ten years ago<br>
            I bought you some cufflinks<br>
            You brought me something<br>
            We both know what memories can bring<br>
            They bring diamonds and rust<br>
            <br>
            Well, you burst on the scene<br>
            Already a legend<br>
            The unwashed phenomenon<br>
            The original vagabond<br>
            You strayed into my arms<br>
            And there you stayed<br>
            Temporarily lost at sea<br>
            The Madonna was yours for free<br>
            Yes, the girl on the half-shell<br>
            Could keep you unharmed<br>
            <br>
            Now I see you standing<br>
            With brown leaves falling all around<br>
            And snow in your hair<br>
            Now you're smiling out the window<br>
            Of that crummy hotel<br>
            Over Washington Square<br>
            Our breath comes out white clouds<br>
            Mingles and hangs in the air<br>
            Speaking strictly for me<br>
            We both could have died then and there<br>
            <br>
            Now you're telling me<br>
            You're not nostalgic<br>
            Then give me another word for it<br>
            You who are so good with words<br>
            And at keeping things vague<br>
            'Cause I need some of that vagueness now<br>
            It's all come back too clearly<br>
            Yes, I loved you dearly<br>
            And if you're offering me diamonds and rust<br>
            I've already paid<br>
        </p>
