        Sitting in a park in Paris France <br>
        Reading the news and it sure looks bad<br>
        They won't give peace a chance<br>
        That was just a dream some of us had<br>
        Still a lot of lands to see<br>
        But I wouldn't want to stay here<br>
        It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here<br>
        Oh but California<br>
        <br>
        California I'm coming home<br>
        I'm going to see the folks I dig<br>
        I'll even kiss a Sunset pig<br>
        California I'm coming home<br>
        <br>
        I met a redneck on a Grecian isle<br>
        Who did the goat dance very well<br>
        He gave me back my smile<br>
        But he kept my camera to sell<br>
        Oh the rogue the red red rogue<br>
        He cooked good omelettes and stews<br>
        And I might have stayed on with him there<br>
        But my heart cried out for you California<br>
        <br>
        Oh California I'm coming home<br>
        Oh make me feel good rock 'n' roll band<br>
        I'm your biggest fan<br>
        California I'm coming home<br>
        <br>
        Oh it gets so lonely<br>
        When you're walking<br>
        And the streets are full of strangers<br>
        All the news of home you read<br>
        Just gives you the blues<br>
        Just gives you the blues<br>
        So I bought me a ticket<br>
        I caught a plane to Spain<br>
        Went to a party down a red dirt road<br>
        There were lots of pretty people there<br>
        Reading Rolling Stone reading Vogue<br>
        They said "How long can you hang around?"<br>
        I said a week maybe two<br>
        Just until my skin turns brown<br>
        Then I'm going home to California<br>
        <br>
        California I'm coming home<br>
        Oh will you take me as I am<br>
        Strung out on another man<br>
        California I'm coming home<br>
        <br>
        Oh it gets so lonely<br>
        When you're walking<br>
        And the streets are full of strangers<br>
        All the news of home you read<br>
        More about the war<br>
        And the bloody changes<br>
        Oh will you take me as I am?<br>
        Will you take me as I am?<br>
        Will you?<br>
        </p>
