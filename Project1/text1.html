        <p id="body">
            During the days of the Ice age, Scrat took an acorn with him everywhere, hoping to find a place to store it for the winter. Scrat also went out looking for other acorns so as to further his storage, looking all over for acorns and nuts.

<br><br>Scrat went on, fixated with taking his acorn until he met another saber-tooth squirrel named Scratte, whom Scrat fell for, forsaking his acorn for a time until he grew to miss it. He returned to his acorn, leaving Scratte behind in a world of dinosaurs.

<br><br>Further on in time, through a mistake, Scrat was responsible for the separation of the continents, which divided Pangaea, the singular landmass, into various continents. After this, Scrat found a paradise on Earth for himself: an island populated by advanced saber-tooth squirrels known as Scratlantis. After finding it, however, Scrat sunk it by mistake, stranding himself in a North American desert.

<br><br>After sinking Scratlantis, Scrat wondered through the landscape with a new acorn in hand. He ended up falling through the ice into a cave. There, he ended up finding a place to finally store his acorn. Apparently, his acorn ended up powering a UFO that was encased in the ice. After confusingly moving the lever, Scrat managed to blast out of the ice and into the cosmos. Up in space, Scrat ended up creating The Solar System, rearranging the planets and causing a collision between two planets, creating the asteroid belt. When the UFO rammed into a giant asteroid, Scrat ended up burying his acorn once again. As Scrat had finally managed to store his acorn successfully, the asteroid ended up cracking and made it's way towards earth. Scrat had once again put the earth in danger because of his obsession over his acorn. Later on, Scrat had no control over his UFO, and ended up crashing on Mars, which had similarly looked like Earth at the time, wiping out all vegetation, water and other life form on the planet.

<br><br>At some point in his future, Scrat was frozen in ice and survived the ice ages, some twenty thousand years later, washing up in a block of ice on a tropical beach. Scrat lost his acorn and found a coconut, which he treated the same as his acorn; however, in storing it, Scrat started a volcanic cataclysm by mistake.
<br><br>Scrat's wildest adventure that he ever embarked on was when he met a baby saber-toothed squirrel while on an acorn hunt, named Baby Scrat, who took an instant liking to Scrat. Scrat cooed how cute Baby Scrat was and took him in as his father. From then on, the two had a solid love for each other, as a happy Scrat cared for, taught, nurtured, and played with his son. Problems would arise between them though, whenever acorns appeared. Baby Scrat had the same love of Acorns that his father has. Acting on natural instincts, any sight of an acorn would set off a chase between them, tussling over who would get it, causing chaos and crazy adventures for both of them. Despite this, the two love each other very deeply, and they always still show affection towards each other.

<br><br>His final known adventure simply consists of him finally eating his beloved acorn.
