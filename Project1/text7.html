        I am a girl of constant sorrow<br>
        I've seen troubles all my days<br>
        I'm going back to California<br>
        The place I was partly raised<br>
        <br>
        All through this world, I'm bound to ramble<br>
        Through sun and wind and driving rain<br>
        I'm bound to ride the western railways<br>
        Perhaps I'll take the very next train<br>
        <br>
        Your friends may think that I'm a stranger<br>
        My face, you'll never see no more<br>
        There's one promise that is given<br>
        I'll see you on God's golden shore<br>
        <br>
        I am a girl of constant sorrow<br>
        I've seen troubles all my days<br>
        I'm going back to California<br>
        The place I was partly raised<br>
