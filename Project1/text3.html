        Help me, I think I'm fallin' in love again
        When I get that crazy feelin', I know I'm in trouble again
        I'm in trouble 'cause you're a rambler and a gambler
        And a sweet talkin' ladies man
        And you love your lovin' (lovin')
        Not like you love your freedom
        Help me, I think I'm fallin' in love too fast
        It's got me hopin' for the future and worryin' about the past
        'Cause I've seen some hot, hot blazes come down to smoke and ash
        We love our lovin' (lovin')
        But not like we love our freedom
        Oh, didn't it feel good? We were sittin' there talkin'
        Or lyin' there not talkin', didn't it feel good?
        Go dance with the lady with the hole in her stockin'
        Didn't it feel good?
        Didn't it feel good?
        Help me, I think I'm fallin' in love with you
        Are you gonna let me go there by myself?
        That's such a lonely thing to do
        Both of us flirtin' around
        Flirtin' and flirtin', hurtin' too
        We love our lovin' (lovin')
        But not like we love our freedom
