        Help me, I think I'm fallin' in love again<br>
        When I get that crazy feelin', I know I'm in trouble again<br>
        I'm in trouble 'cause you're a rambler and a gambler<br>
        And a sweet talkin' ladies man<br>
        And you love your lovin' (lovin')<br>
        Not like you love your freedom<br>
        Help me, I think I'm fallin' in love too fast<br>
        It's got me hopin' for the future and worryin' about the past<br>
        'Cause I've seen some hot, hot blazes come down to smoke and ash<br>
        We love our lovin' (lovin')<br>
        But not like we love our freedom<br>
        Oh, didn't it feel good? We were sittin' there talkin'<br>
        Or lyin' there not talkin', didn't it feel good?<br>
        Go dance with the lady with the hole in her stockin'<br>
        Didn't it feel good?<br>
        Didn't it feel good?<br>
        Help me, I think I'm fallin' in love with you<br>
        Are you gonna let me go there by myself?<br>
        That's such a lonely thing to do<br>
        Both of us flirtin' around<br>
        Flirtin' and flirtin', hurtin' too<br>
        We love our lovin' (lovin')<br>
        But not like we love our freedom<br>
