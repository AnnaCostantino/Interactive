        Rows and floes of angel hair<br>
        And ice cream castles in the air<br>
        And feather canyons everywhere<br>
        I've looked at clouds that way<br>
        <br>
        But now they only block the sun<br>
        They rain and snow on everyone<br>
        So many things I would have done<br>
        But clouds got in my way<br>
        <br>
        I've looked at clouds from both sides now<br>
        From up and down, and still somehow<br>
        It's cloud illusions I recall<br>
        I really don't know clouds at all<br>
        <br>
        Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels<br>
        The dizzy dancing way you feel<br>
        As every fairy tale comes real<br>
        I've looked at love that way<br>
        <br>
        But now it's just another show<br>
        You leave 'em laughing when you go<br>
        And if you care, don't let them know<br>
        Don't give yourself away<br>
        <br>
        I've looked at love from both sides now<br>
        From give and take, and still somehow<br>
        It's love's illusions I recall<br>
        I really don't know love at all<br>
        <br>
        Tears and fears and feeling proud<br>
        To say "I love you" right out loud<br>
        Dreams and schemes and circus crowds<br>
        I've looked at life that way<br>
        <br>
        But now old friends are acting strange<br>
        They shake their heads, they say I've changed<br>
        Well something's lost, but something's gained<br>
        In living every day<br>
        <br>
        I've looked at life from both sides now<br>
        From win and lose and still somehow<br>
        It's life's illusions I recall<br>
        I really don't know life at all<br>
        <br>
        I've looked at life from both sides now<br>
        From up and down and still somehow<br>
        It's life's illusions I recall<br>
        I really don't know life at all<br>
